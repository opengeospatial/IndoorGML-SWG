=== Indoor Space

A space within one or multiple buildings.

=== Cellular Space

A cellular space _S_ is a set of identifiable sells _c_~_i_~ grouped according to theme _T_ and is noted _S_^_T_^ is _S_^_T_^ = {_c_~1~, _c_~2~, â€¦, _c_~_n_~}

=== Graph

A graph _G_ (_V_, _E_) where _V_ is a set of nodes representing cells and _E_ is the set of edges indicating topological relationships.

=== Adjacency Graph

A graph _G_~_adj_~ (_V_, _E_~_adj_~) where _V_ is a set of nodes representing cells and _E_~_adj_~ is the set of edges indicating the adjacency relationship.

=== Connectivity Graph

A graph G~con~(_V_, _E_~con~) where _V_ is a set of nodes representing cells in indoor space and _E_~_con_~ is the set of edges indicating the connectivity relationship.

=== Logical Network

A graph _G_ (_V_, _E_), where node _v_ in _V_ and edge _e_ in _E_ do not contain any geometric properties.

=== Geometric Network

A graph _G_ (_V_, _E_) where node _v_ in _V_ and edge _e_ in _E_ contain both geometric properties.

=== Multi-Layered Space Model

A model representing multiple themes of cellular spaces and/or graphs and inter-layer connections between them.
