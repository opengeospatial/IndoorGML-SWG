[[section-datadictionary]]
== Data Dictionary and Requirements

In this section, we present the data dictionary of the feature types defined in IndoorGML 2.0 UML class diagram.
It aims to clarify the concepts of each feature type and help the implementation of this standard.
The data dictionary is defined based on ISO standards from TC 211, particularly <<ISO_19109,ISO 19109>> for the rules for application schema, <<ISO_19107,ISO 19107>> for spatial schema, and <<ISO_19136-1,ISO 19136-1>> for GML.
As IndoorGML 2.0 is an application schema from these base standards, we will not include the data dictionary for the feature types defined by these standards in section.
For example, the properties of GML AbstractFeature such as gmlID, and name are not described in the data dictionary.
The data dictionary of the feature types defined in <<section-data-model>> is given in the following subsections.

part:: ObjectSpace instances also fall under the non-overlapping constraint of CellSpaces. As such, they shall not overlap with any other CellSpace or its specialized classes. Therefore, ObjectSpace can either be carved out of the space containing them or they can be defined in different layers (to avoid complex Boolean operations for example).
