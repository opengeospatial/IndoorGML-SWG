[[section-datadictionary]]
== Data Dictionary and Requirements

In this section, the data dictionary of the feature types defined in IndoorGML 2.0 UML class diagram are defined.
The aim is to clarify the concepts of each feature type and help the implementation of this standard.
The data dictionary is defined based on ISO TC 211 Standards, particularly <<ISO_19109,ISO 19109>> for the rules for application schema, <<ISO_19107,ISO 19107>> for spatial schema, and <<ISO_19136-1,ISO 19136>> for GML.
As IndoorGML 2.0 is a model based on these base standards, the data dictionary for the feature types defined by these standards is not included in this section.
For example, the properties of GML AbstractFeature such as *gmlID*, and *name* are not described in the data dictionary.
The data dictionary of the feature types defined in <<section-data-model>> is provided in the following subsections.
