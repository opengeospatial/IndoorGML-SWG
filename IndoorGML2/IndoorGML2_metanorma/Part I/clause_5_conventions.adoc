In this standard, the following three stereotypes of UML classes are used.

* \<<Interface>> A definition of a set of operations that is supported by objects having this interface. An Interface class cannot contain any attributes.
* \<<DataType>> A descriptor of a set of values that lack identity (independent existence and the possibility of side effects). A DataType is a class with no operations whose primary purpose is to hold the information.
* \<<CodeList>> is a flexible enumeration that uses string values for expressing a list of potential values.

In this standard, the following standard data types are used:

* CharacterString – A sequence of characters;
* Boolean – A binary value of either 1 (true) or 0 (false);
* Integer – An integer number;
* Double – A double precision floating point number; and
* Float – A single precision floating point number.
