IndoorGML is an OGC^*Â®*^ standard for the representation and exchange of indoor navigation network models. IndoorGML is a UML conceptual schema and implementation schema of the Geography Markup Language version 3.2.1.

This version of IndoorGML establishes a common schema for indoor navigation applications. It models topology and semantics of indoor spaces, which are needed for the components of navigation networks. IndoorGML contains a minimum set of generic, unified modelling concepts for indoor environments as follows:

* Spaces and space subdivision contexts;
* Geometric and semantic properties of spaces;
* Types of connectivity between spaces;
* Navigation networks (logical and metric) and their relationships.
