The OGC IndoorGML Standard is for the representation and interoperable exchange of indoor navigation network models.
IndoorGML 2.0 Part 1 is a conceptual schema documented using UML and Part 2 is an implementation schema of the Geography Markup Language version 3.2.1.

IndoorGML establishes a common schema for indoor space model and indoor navigation applications.
It models topology and semantics of indoor spaces, which are needed for the components of navigation networks and defines a minimum set of generic, unified modelling concepts for indoor environments as follows:

* Spaces and space subdivision contexts;
* Geometric and semantic properties of spaces;
* Types of connectivity between spaces;
* Navigation networks (logical and metric) and their relationships.
